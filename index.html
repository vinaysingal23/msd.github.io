        <h2>LEGEND OF INDIAN CRICKET</h2>
        <P>Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the most decorated captain in the history of Indian cricket. Rising from a small city
            of Ranchi to reaching the top of world cricket, his incredible journey is an inspiration for billions of
            people. It gives them the belief that nothing is impossible. All it needs is hard work and dedication. No
            one will forget him running the Bangladesh player out without even looking at the stumps. He holds the
            record for the most number of successful stumping. He's lighting fast behind the wickets and between the
            stumps.</P>
